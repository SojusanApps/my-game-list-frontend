## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** v20 or higher recommended.
- **pnpm:** v10 or higher. Enable via Corepack (`corepack enable`) or install from [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- **Backend:** The application relies on the [My Game List Backend](https://github.com/MyGameListPlaceholder/my-game-list-backend). Ensure you have access to the backend API and its `openapi.json` definition.

## 📥 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-game-list-frontend.git
   cd my-game-list-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup:**
   The project uses environment variables. You can check `env/.env.development` for reference.
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory if you need custom configurations:

   ```bash
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **API Definition:**
   The `dev` script expects the backend's `openapi.json` file to generate the API client.
   - **Option A:** Have the backend project checked out at `../my-game-list-backend/`. The script will attempt to copy `openapi.json` from there.
   - **Option B:** Manually place the `openapi.json` file in the root of this project before running dev.
